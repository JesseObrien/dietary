## Mission

To provide tools to improve adherence to healthy dietary patterns.

### The Problem
(TODO: This seems less of a "mission" thing, but I don't know where else to put this at the moment.)

Studies have shown that adherence to diet is more important than the type of diet, yet upwards of half to three 
quarters of people fail to adhere to dietary guidelines **even when their quality of life (or even life itself) 
depends on it**.

This is clearly not a good thing.

With the rise of such conditions as Type II Diabetes, Celiac, and other disorders that can be mitigated 
or managed entirely through diet and lifestyle changes, it becomes more important than ever that people 
succeed in making these changes.

### A Solution

Why is the adherence rate so abysmal? Part of the reason is complexity -- or even just perception of 
complexity. There is a lot of conflicting information in the health and wellness world. Sometimes, you 
just need someone to tell you "eat this."

Dietary is that "someone."
