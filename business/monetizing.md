# Monetization Ideas

## Freemium/Paid Plans

- Possibily a limited "free" tier
  - 1 meal a day?
- Low-price upgrade packages ("the Netflix limit")
- Family plans/addons (Say, $5 more gets you +3 joint accounts)

## Sponsorships/Paid Recipes

- Sponsors pay to have their name/logo splashed on a recipe.
- Can be companies, or food bloggers looking to get some extra traffic.
